# Testing out GIT
This is an activity from Mobile Development, wherein we are tasked to practice collaborating using GIT.

## What we have tried so far
1. Fork another repository
2. Create a new branch
    - `git checkout -b <new_branch>`
3. Create a pull request for the new branch
4. Sync fork
    - `git fetch upstream`
    - `git merge upstream/master`
    - `git push origin`
5. Delete merged branch
    - `git branch -d <branch_name>`
